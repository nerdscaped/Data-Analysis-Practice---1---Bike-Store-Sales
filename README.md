# Data-Analysis-Practice---1---Bike-Store-Sales
Project where I practice my python DA coding to simulate as closely as possible work as a professional data analyst.

Data is from a fictional shop selling a range of bikes and accessories in multiple international locations. I envisage to perform my data analysis as if I was presenting a report in a board meeting, where my inferences are used to directly influence decision-making.
