# Data-Analysis-Practice---1---Bike-Store-Sales
This project is aimed at improving my Python, Excel and Tableau ability in order to prepare me for a data analyst role. 

The dataset outlays sales data of a chain of fictional international bike shops, situated in six countries, with customer demographics, product information and costs/revenue included for each data point (totalling over 113,000). 

I chose this dataset as I wanted to investigate whether working with sales data was something that interested me, as this would give me a better understanding of what kind of data analyst job was for me. Further, not only did it include demographic data, it also included product information, so I intuited that it would be a strong dataset for me to investigate, with plenty of potential avenues of exploration. 

The objective of the project is the help the board decide where/how it will be best for the board to spend their marketing budget. This is done by identifying the customers that are currently contributing most to profits and sales, with this information presented in a report and a presentation.
